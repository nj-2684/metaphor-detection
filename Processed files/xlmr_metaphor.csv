 Aksaram means that which does not perish (na ksarati), the supreme Self. This agrees with the Upanisadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi৷৷.' (Br. 3.8.9).

 Agnih, fire-is a deity presiding over a period of time; similarly, jyotih, light-also is a deity presiding over a period of time. Or fire and light are the well-known Vedic deities.
As the expression 'mango grove' is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous, similarly, the expressions 'at which time' and 'that time' (in the earlier verse) are used in view of the predominance (of the deities presiding over time). [If the first two (fire and light) are taken as Vedic deities, then the remaining three are the only deities of time.
